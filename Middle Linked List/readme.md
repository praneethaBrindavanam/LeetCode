# 876. Middle of the Linked List  

**Difficulty:** Easy  

Given the `head` of a singly linked list, return the **middle node** of the linked list.  

If there are two middle nodes, return **the second middle node**.

### Example 1:  
**Input:**  
```plaintext
head = [1,2,3,4,5]
```

**Output:**  
```plaintext
[3,4,5]
```

**Explanation:**  
```plaintext
The linked list is: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5  
The middle node is 3.
```

### Example 2:  
**Input:**  
```plaintext
head = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
```

**Output:**  
```plaintext
[4,5,6]
```

**Explanation:**  
```plaintext
The linked list is: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → 6  
There are two middle nodes (3 and 4), so we return the second one (4).
```

### Constraints:  
- The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[1, 100]`.  
- `1 <= Node.val <= 100`
