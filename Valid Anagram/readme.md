# 242. Valid Anagram  

**Difficulty:** Easy  

Given two strings `s` and `t`, return `true` if `t` is an anagram of `s`, and `false` otherwise.  

An **anagram** is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

### Example 1:  
**Input:**  
```plaintext
s = "anagram", t = "nagaram"
```

**Output:**  
```plaintext
true
```

**Explanation:**  
```plaintext
Both strings contain the same characters in the same frequency.
```

### Example 2:  
**Input:**  
```plaintext
s = "rat", t = "car"
```

**Output:**  
```plaintext
false
```

**Explanation:**

The characters do not match in frequency.
```

### Constraints:  
- `1 <= s.length, t.length <= 5 * 10⁴`  
- `s` and `t` consist of lowercase English letters.
